Hi there! I’m a researcher working at the intersection of AI and healthcare, with a soft
spot for Bayesian statistics, uncertainty quantification, information theory, and any
problem that requires a bit of mathematical thinking to untangle.

Most of my work lives in the space where data meets decision-making — whether it's
building smarter systems for healthcare or thinking through how we can make AI more
trustworthy and grounded in reality. I'm especially interested in modeling uncertainty,
and I tend to get excited about anything that helps us understand why a model behaves
the way it does.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about AI in general or in healthcare, or even
if you want to convince me that "infinity" is a real concept. :)
